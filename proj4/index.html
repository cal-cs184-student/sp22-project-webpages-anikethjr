<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, we worked on cloth simulation by modelling a cloth as a system of point masses connected to each other by springs. We used this model to compute the various forces on the masses and then simulated the cloth's movements by applying these forces on all the masses. Finally, we also explored shaders and different techniques that can be used build them.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
  <p>In the first part of the project, we implemented a cloth as a grid of point masses connected by springs. There were 3 constraints that we implemented: structural, shearing and bending. Here are a couple pictures of our wireframe from different angles. </p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
<p>After creating the cloth as a system of masses and springs, we computed the various forces on each point mass. These included external forces such as gravity and internal forces due to spring deformations. External forces are easy to compute using the F = ma equation. Computing the internal forces required us to use Hooke's law - we computed the deformation in every spring, used Hooke's law to compute the force on each point mass and applied equal but opposite forces on the masses. After computing the net force on a mass, we applied the net force on it using Verlet integration to get its updated position. We also made the simulation a little more realistic by adding damping and constraining the position updates to not be too drastic.</p>

<p>Changing the spring constant ks affects the rigidity of the cloth as internal spring forces are directly proportional to ks. For example, if we choose a very small ks value (=2 N/m here), the cloth has a lot more creases and is less rigid with a lot of vibrations. It also hangs lower when compared to a higher value of ks:</p>

<div align="middle">
    <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part2_small_ks_0.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
        </td>

        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part2_small_ks_2.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <caption>Screenshots of scene/pinned2.json with low ks (=2 N/m). The first screenshot is shortly after the start, the second is in the middle of the simulation and the last is at the end.</caption>
  </div>

<p>On the other hand, using a high ks value (=50,000 N/m here), the cloth is more rigid, has fewer creases and has fewer vibrations. It also hangs higher:</p>

<div align="middle">
    <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part2_large_ks_0.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part2_large_ks_1.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part2_large_ks_2.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <caption>Screenshots of scene/pinned2.json with high ks (=50,000 N/m). The first screenshot is shortly after the start, the second is in the middle of the simulation and the last is at the end.</caption>
  </div>


<p>Density is inversely proportional to the rigidity of the cloth. This is because the increased mass of the point masses leads to smaller effects of spring forces. The magnitude of the spring forces is independent of the mass of the objects as per Hooke's law. Thus, for a given value of spring force, the acceleration of a point mass is inversely proportional to its mass, leading to smaller restorative acceleration and thus lower rigidity. The acceleration caused by external forces is independent of mass. So, if we choose a large density value (=100 g/cm2 here), the cloth has a lot more creases and is less rigid with more noticable vibrations. It also hangs lower when compared to a lower value of density:</p>

<div align="middle">

  </div>

<p>On the other hand, using a low density value (=1 g/cm2 here), the cloth is more rigid, has fewer creases and has fewer vibrations. It also hangs higher:</p>

  </div>


<p>Damping affects the speed with which forces act on the cloth. Increasing damping leads to a slower simulation with the cloth more gradually being affected by both external and internal forces. This is because damping is used to simulate energy lost due to friction, heat and other factors and leads to the reduction of velocity. Although the final resting state of the cloth is similar for low and high values of damping, the cloth takes much longer to reach this resting state with high damping. Here are some screenshots with a relatively low damping value (=0.2):</p>

<div align="middle">
    <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part2_small_damping_0.png" align="middle" width="480px" />

Here are some screenshots with a relatively higher damping value (~0.9) - the cloth takes much longer to get to these points when compared to a low damping value simulation:</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>

<p>In this part, we handled collisions of the cloth with other objects in the scene. First, we handled collisions with spheres. This is done by checking if the position of a point mass is inside the sphere after the external and internal forces have acted on it. We can easily test for this by examining the distance of a mass from the centre of the sphere and if this distance is less than the radius, it means that the position is inside the sphere. If this is the case, we determine the point at which the mass would've touched the sphere just before entering it and update the position of the mass to this intersection point (while also accounting for some friction). Here are some results obtained using this step for the cloth from scene/sphere.json for different values of ks (the final resting states are shown):</p>

<div align="middle">
    <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part3_ks_500.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
          <figcaption align="middle">ks = 500</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part3_ks_5000.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
          <figcaption align="middle">ks = 5000</figcaption>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part3_ks_50000.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
          <figcaption align="middle">ks = 50000</figcaption>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <caption>Screenshots of scene/sphere.json in the final resting state with different values of ks. </caption>
  </div>
  As the ks value increases, the cloth becomes more rigid as described in the previous section. Thus, we see fewer creases and folds as ks increases. The cloth also tends to hang a bit higher due to larger spring forces.

  <p>Next, we handled collisions of the cloth with planes. This was done by determining if the last position of a point mass lies on the same side of the plane as its updated position. If they are on opposite sides, the mass has collided with the plane. If this is the case, we again determine where the mass would've collided with the plane and update its position to this intersection point (again, accounting for friction). Here is a screenshot of the cloth from scene/plane.json lying peacefully at rest on the plane:</p>

    <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/part3_plane.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <caption>Screenshot of scene/plane.json in the final resting state.</caption>
  </div>


<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>

<p>We implemented self-collisions in this part. Since computing self-collisions for all pairs of particles is very inefficient, we resort to a spatial hashmap. This hashmap groups together all masses that are close to each other spatially. The grouping is peformed by computing a spatial hash that is the same for all particles that are close to each other. We break up the full space of the scene into smaller cubes. Every cube is assigned a unique hash value = (x / width) + (y / height)*100.0 + (z / max(width, height))*1000.0 where (x, y, z) is the coordinate of the top left corner of the cube. Then, for every point mass, we compute the cube which contains it, compute the hash of the cube and add the point mass to the group of point masses with the same hash. To compute self collisions for a given point mass, we only need to check for collisions between other point masses contained inside the same cube, greatly reducing the number of computations. If there is a collision, we update the positions of the masses so that they are sufficiently away from each other.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots showing how the cloth from scene/selfCollision.json folds because of self-collisions at various points in time:</p>

<div align="middle">
    <table style="width=100%">

<p>Increasing ks increases cloth rigidity as mentioned in previous sections. Thus, if ks is reduced, the cloth folds on itself more with more creases and folds. Similarly if ks is increased, the number of creases and folds decreases. The screenshots below show this effect:</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h2>

  <p>A shader is a optimized program which runs independently and in parallel to help optimize certain parts of the graphics pipeline- particularly shading components. There are 2 times of shaders: vertex and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders modify the object vertices and can tranform their position/normal/other geometric properties. Fragment shaders, on the other hand, process a fragment of a scene to write out a single color for what that pixel should be. A fragment in particular encodes all the info to draw a pixel. So the way vertex shaders and fragment shaders work together is that vertex shaders cacluate all the info for vertices in a 3d mesh, then they are interpolated with barycentric interpolation; finally fragment shaders use the information from these vertex shaders to calcuate pixel values and visual surface effects.</p>

  <p>The Blinn-Phong shading model is a method of rendering reflections. Using the Blinn-Phong shading model, we can add ambient (effects of ambient light), diffuse (reflected light that is scattered equally in all directions), specular (reflections from light sources) components to shade the cloth model. Here is a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.</p>

  <p>We implemented bump and displacement mapping. Bump mapping is where you assign a height for every point on a suface, and set the shading correspondingly (without changing the location of the vertices), so we only need to make changes to the fragment shader. Displacement mapping, on the other hand moves the vertices itself so we need to make changes to the vertex shaders as well.</p>

  <p>In terms of the below renders for bump and displacement mapping, we can see that both affect the appearance of the objects as intended. However, bump mapping doesn't change the behavior of the objects, while displacement mapping actually moves vertices around. In terms of the various coasenesses we tried, they have a minimal effect, but the more course spheres were not as round. </p>
